    "Here we'll demo a simple implementation of a pipeline that takes in sensitive data and stores it securely, before ultimately fine-tune a gpt model on it. And well, it'll just be a kaggle data in this case, but the point is to introduce one method to handle data that may be sensitive yet required for a fine-tuning job. The process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Ingest data\n",
    " - Generate synthetic data\n",
    " - Encrypt the data\n",
    " - Decrypt and fine-tune the data\n",
    " - Test inference with the new model\n",

    "The dataset we'll use to demonstrate this is on financial transactions data, which you can get here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismetsemedov/transactions. Now you'll quickly notice it is not natural language data fit for a fine-tuning job with an LLM, hence why we have a synthetic data generation step in our pipeling - we'll use the tabular data to simulate natural language financial transaction data. Moreover, you'll also see a lot of features that we won't actually need as this is data meant for fraud detection, but we are juts adapting it for our use case.\n",

While the model was trained on just a small sample of data, you will see that it is still able to accurately categorize transactions based on natural language inputs — showing the power and practicality of LLM fine-tuning even on lightweight prototypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a real production LLM system, this approach will naturally be extended with more complex components. Some things you might consider looking into include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-loop feedback**: Letting users manually correct misclassifications and feeding those corrections back into the training data.\n",
    "- **Live re-training or continual fine-tuning**: Periodically updating the model as new transaction types, merchants, or edge cases emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "And on the **data security** side, additional steps could might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Field-level encryption**: Encrypting specific fields (e.g., card number, IP address) even within the training data, for stricter compliance.\n",
    "- **Differential privacy**: Adding noise to training data or model outputs to limit the ability to reconstruct individual examples.\n",
